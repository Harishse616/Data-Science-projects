## Importing the dataset
"""



import pandas as pd

url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
df = pd.read_csv(url, header = None)

df.head()

df.size

df.shape

## the output shows 150,5 which means the dataset has 150 rows and five columns

df.columns

## the output shows numbers cuz the column names are number -_-!

df.columns = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species']

df.columns

## now we have successfully renamed the columns

df.info()

## in the output we can see that there are 150 entries from 0 to 49
## and the names of the columns and their datatype , so for species we can
## use groupby to form groups of them and analyse so that we can know :
## how many flower species are there , how many samples from each species , and
## study each species , like how much variation is found in their petal sizes and etc..

df.describe()

## in the output we can see that
 #   there are 150 entries
 #   and the typical legnthe of sepal is 5.8 approx
 #   and sepal width is 3 approx and petal length is 3.7 approx and
 #   petal width is 1.2 approx ; according to mean
 #   according to std ; ther is huge variation in sepal length , petal legth
 #   and petal width , but sepal width does vary that much
 #   and the smallest entries are given by small
 #   largest values are given by max
 #   25 percentile , 5 percentile and 75 percentile of each column is given aswell

df['species'].unique()

# so there are three different species

df['species'].value_counts()

# so each of the species have 50 entries each

df.isnull()

#since there are no null values , next we can plot
